# Derivative-Calculator
This is the derivative calculator. This program lets you enter a mathematical expression, such as cos(x), and get its derivative (-sin(x) in this case).
To use it, download both the Derivative Calculator back-end and front-end files.
Then, you can read the rules for inputting your mathematical expression on the front-end file and obtain the derivative from there.
